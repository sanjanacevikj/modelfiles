# modelfiles
This repository consists of files from the SIR &amp; Voter Model Simulation Executions

SIR MODEL
For the SIR Model the fraction infected used is the constant through all of the simulations and it's 0.05, meaning the starting off point is low. 

In each of the SIR Files the beta and the gamma parametars are different and are given in the specific file.

VOTER MODEL

For the Voter model in each file the only parametar which is changed is the fraction infected.
